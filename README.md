Description:  Sheet music clips rotate randomly based on the key signatures and time signatures selected.  Rotation can be done through auto-rotation or by clicking on the image.

Progress: Randomization works well and only includes the key & time signatures selected for.  The current key & time signatures are displayed through a textView on the top of the imageView.  

Working on: Adding sheet music clips for the imageView to display.

Description: The auto-rotate buttons control when the sheet music clips change.   Includes  “fast” and “slow” speeds and on/off buttons to allow the user to manually rotate.

Progress:  Rotation buttons interact well with each other and can disappear when not in use.

Working on:  Adding more speed options.  Allowing rotation to work properly everytime the speed button is clicked.

Bugs: Rotation countdown skips over when speed buttons are clicked many times in quick succession.
